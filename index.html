					<p>
						GRAIL 2025 is the seventh international <b>Workshop on GRaphs in biomedicAl Image anaLysis</b>,
						organised as an in-person satellite event of MICCAI 2025 in Daejeon, Korea.
						This year, GRAIL returns as a dynamic full-day workshop, also featuring three specialized tracks: 
						(1) Graphs in Biomedical Image Analysis, 
						(2) <a href="https://topology-miccai.github.io/TGI_2025.html" target="_blank">Topology- and Imaging-Informed Graph Informatics (TGI)</a>, and 
						(3) <a href="https://www.gaoyue.org/activity/MICCAI%202025%20Workshop%20Track:%20Hypergraph%20Computation%20for%20Medical%20Image%20Analysis" target="_blank">Hypergraph Computation for Medical Image Analysis</a>.
						These focused sessions will spotlight the latest advancements in graph-based AI for medical imaging, 
						bringing together leading researchers and innovators for a day of cutting-edge insights and collaboration.
					</p>
					
					<!-- <<p>	Graph-based models have been developed for a wide variety of problems in computer vision and biomedical image analysis. Applications ranging from segmentation, registration, classification, and shape modelling, to population analysis have been successfully encoded through graph structures, demonstrating the versatile and principled nature of the graph based approaches.</p>

<p>Graphs are powerful mathematical structures which provide a flexible and scalable framework to model objects and their interactions in a readily interpretable fashion. As a consequence, an important body of work has been developed around different methodological aspects of graph including, but not limited to, graphical models, graph-theoretical algorithms, spectral graph analysis, graph dimensionality reduction, and graph-based network analysis. However, new topics are also emerging as the outcome of interdisciplinary studies, shedding light on areas like deep structured models and signal processing on graphs. </p>

<p>With this workshop we aim to highlight the potential of using graph-based models for biomedical image analysis. Our goal is to bring together scientists that use and develop graph-based models for the analysis of biomedical images and encourage the exploration of graph-based models for difficult clinical problems within a variety of biomedical imaging contexts. </p> -->
					

						<!-- Graphs are powerful mathematical structures that provide a flexible and scalable framework

						such as spectral analysis, dimensionality reduction, and network analysis. Since 2017, 
						geometric deep learning has married the field of graph signal processing with the flexibility 
						and rapid advancements of deep neural architectures. Since then, applications of graph neural 
						networks (GNNs) in medicine have been steadily increasing, ranging from medical imaging and 
						shape understanding, brain connectomics, population models and patient multi-omics to 
						discovery and design of novel drugs and therapeutics. In the leading computer vision and 
						ML conferences (CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS), GNNs have been among the hottest topics in 2022 and 2023 and
						will likely increase in interest in 2024. With this workshop, we aim to provide a platform 
						for understanding and application of  graph-based models as versatile and powerful tools in 
						biomedical image analysis and beyond. Our goal is to bring together scientists that develop 
						graph-based models, and encourage their application to difficult clinical problems within 
						a variety of biomedical data contexts. GRAIL 2023 featured keynote presentations from 
						leading researchers in the graph community, and paper submissions on a wide range of 
						topics, from brain connectomics and whole-slide image analytics, over semantic priors from 
						biomedical knowledge graphs, explainable AI approaches for GNNs, to GNN-based genome 
						alignment and their incorporation into multi-omics patient representations. For 2024, we 
						expect a similarly exciting lineup of keynotes and paper submission. -->

						
<p>Graphs provide a flexible and scalable mathematical framework to model complex, unstructured data in an interpretable manner. They serve as a foundation for advanced computational models, enabling key techniques such as spectral analysis, dimensionality reduction, and network analysis. Since 2017, geometric deep learning has revolutionized the field by integrating graph signal processing with deep neural architectures, driving innovation in various medical domains. Today, GNNs are widely applied in medical imaging, shape analysis, brain connectomics, population models, patient multi-omics, and drug discovery. Their impact has grown significantly, with increasing visibility at leading machine learning and computer vision conferences such as CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS, where they have emerged as a dominant research area in recent years. GRAIL aims to bridge the gap between theory and application, creating a space where scientists developing graph-based models can collaborate with researchers tackling complex clinical challenges across diverse biomedical datasets. GRAIL 2023 featured keynote talks from leading experts and showcased groundbreaking research in brain connectomics, whole-slide image analytics, biomedical knowledge graphs, explainable AI for GNNs, and multi-omics patient representations. GRAIL 2024 continued this momentum with contributions spanning multimodal fusion in GNNs, topological deep learning for drug discovery, disease classification in ophthalmology and Parkinson's disease, and histopathological graph-based analysis. For GRAIL 2025, we aim to expand the workshop's reach and impact by introducing several new initiatives. Our GRAIL Journal Club, launched in 2024, will continue with regular sessions throughout the year, fostering ongoing discussions beyond the MICCAI event. We are also extending our "Getting Started with GNNs" initiative, providing curated resourcesâ€”including tutorials, code repositories (e.g., PyG/DGL), multimodal datasets, and highlighted papersâ€”to support newcomers and experts alike. Additionally, we are launching a Spotlight Track for MICCAI main conference papers, allowing authors to present short abstracts and single-slide spotlights to enhance visibility and cross-pollination between conference and workshop attendees. To ensure broader accessibility, we will video-record all sessions and improve AV quality for publishing on a dedicated GRAIL YouTube channel. This year, we further broaden our scope to include Topological Deep Learning (TDL), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Foundation Models (FMs), and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with graphs/GNNs/KGs, particularly in areas such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for biomedical applications. Through these efforts, GRAIL 2025 aims to remain at the forefront of graph-based research in biomedical image analysis, providing a dynamic and inclusive platform for advancing this rapidly evolving field.</p>

								Talk title: Multi-resolution Learning on Graphs for Connectomic Features in Neuroimaging
							</b>
						</h4>
						

						<p>
							<b>Abstract:</b> Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are recognized as disconnection syndrome, as they damage to the white matter connectome connecting different brain regions of interest (ROIs) and disrupt information flow. To characterize such pathology, the brain is represented as a graph, i.e., brain network, whose nodes correspond to the anatomical ROIs and edges are derived from connectivity between the ROIs. In this talk, I will cover a variety of graph machine learning (ML) methods --- from statistical methods to deep learning --- under the concept of multi-resolution representation in traditional signal processing. These methods are designed to learn scale-specific parameters for multi-resolution representation of graphs rather than exhaustive parameterization with complicated architectures. This principled approach leads to more efficient, interpretable, and robust models, particularly well-suited for the small-sample regimes commonly found in medical imaging studies.

							<b>Bio:</b> Tamara MÃ¼ller is a researcher in Artificial Intelligence for Medicine and Healthcare, with a Ph.D. from the Technical University of Munich (2024), where she worked in the lab of Professor Daniel Rueckert. Her doctoral research explored how graph neural networks (GNNs) can be applied to medical applications â€” from modeling population graphs that capture relationships across large patient cohorts, to analyzing anatomical mesh data and designing clinically relevant predictive models. She also contributed to advancing privacy-preserving techniques, namely differential privacy, for GNNs, ensuring that sensitive medical data can be protected while enabling graph learning. Tamara is currently applying her expertise as a senior research scientist at Korro AI, where she works on developing next-generation AI technologies for occupational therapy for children.

								Talk title: Geometric View of the Diffusion Models for Image Reconstruction
							</b>
						</h4>
						

						<p>
							<b>Abstract:</b> The recent emergence of diffusion models has driven substantial progress in image and video processing, establishing them as powerful generative priors. However, it is still not well understood why diffusion models outperform GANs or how they relate to traditional signal processing approaches. In this talk, we present a geometric perspective on diffusion models to uncover these connections. First, we highlight a close relationship between diffusion models and classical quantum mechanics, revealing intriguing discrete orbit geometries. We then show that diffusion models naturally constitute a scale-space representation of the data distribution, in contrast to the classical scale-space representation of the samples themselves. This geometric understanding makes conditional sampling for image reconstruction not only more intuitive but also more firmly grounded in theory.

							</b>
						</h4>

						<p>
							<b>Abstract:</b> In this tutorial talk, Prof. Hajij will provide a practical introduction to topological deep learning (TDL). Building on the foundations he presented in his GRAIL keynote last year, he will now move beyond theory to explore the practical aspects of TDL that he only briefly outlined previously. The focus will be on the open-source TopoX ecosystem, developed by his lab at the University of San Francisco, with a deep dive into modules such as TopoNetX and TopoModelX. Through hands-on workflows and code examples, the session will demonstrate how topological architectures can be constructed and applied in practice, making TDL accessible to researchers who wish to bring these methods into biomedical imaging and related domains.
