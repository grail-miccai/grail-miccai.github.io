					<p>GRAIL 2022 is the fourth international <b>workshop on GRaphs in biomedicAl Image anaLysis</b>,
						organised as a satellite event of MICCAI 2022 in Singapore.</p>

					<!-- <<p>	Graph-based models have been developed for a wide variety of problems in computer vision and biomedical image analysis. Applications ranging from segmentation, registration, classification, and shape modelling, to population analysis have been successfully encoded through graph structures, demonstrating the versatile and principled nature of the graph based approaches.</p>

<p>Graphs are powerful mathematical structures which provide a flexible and scalable framework to model objects and their interactions in a readily interpretable fashion. As a consequence, an important body of work has been developed around different methodological aspects of graph including, but not limited to, graphical models, graph-theoretical algorithms, spectral graph analysis, graph dimensionality reduction, and graph-based network analysis. However, new topics are also emerging as the outcome of interdisciplinary studies, shedding light on areas like deep structured models and signal processing on graphs. </p>

<p>With this workshop we aim to highlight the potential of using graph-based models for biomedical image analysis. Our goal is to bring together scientists that use and develop graph-based models for the analysis of biomedical images and encourage the exploration of graph-based models for difficult clinical problems within a variety of biomedical imaging contexts. </p> -->

						Graphs are powerful mathematical structures that provide a flexible and scalable framework to
						model objects and their interactions in a
						readily interpretable fashion. As a result, an important body of work has been developed around
						different methodological aspects of graphs including, but not limited to, graphical models,
						graph-theoretical algorithms, spectral graph analysis, graph dimensionality reduction, and
						graph-based network analysis.
						Critically, since 2017, the field has experienced a steep increase in research due to the
						nascency of geometric deep learning,
						which married principles of graph signal processing with the latest advancements in deep neural
						networks. Applications of GNNs in
						medicine are numerous, ranging from medical imaging and shape understanding, brain connectomics,
						population models and patient multi-omics
						to discovery and design of novel drugs and therapeutics. In the leading computer vision and ML
						conferences (CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS), GNNs have been
						among the hottest topics in 2021 and will likely increase in interest in 2022. With this
						workshop, we aim to provide a platform for understanding
						and application of graph-based models as versatile and powerful tools in biomedical image
						analysis and beyond. Our goal is to bring together scientists
						that use and develop graph-based models, and encourage the application of these models to
						difficult clinical problems within a variety of biomedical data
						contexts. Compared to our previous GRAIL installments, we specifically encourage submissions in
						the areas of explainable GNNs, graph models in computer-aided
						surgery/intervention, unstructured medical big data, and semantic knowledge (scene/knowledge
						graphs).

					</p>

					<h2>In more detail, the scope of methodology topics includes but is not limited to:</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Deep/machine learning on graphs with regular and irregular structures</li>
						<li>Probabilistic graphical models for biomedical data analysis</li>
						<li>Signal processing on graphs for biomedical image analysis, including non-learning based
							approaches</li>
						<li>Explainable AI (XAI) methods in geometric deep learning</li>
						<li>Big data analysis with graphs</li>
						<li>Semantic graph research in medicine: Scene graphs and knowledge graphs</li>
						<li>Modeling and applications of graph symmetry and equivariance</li>
						<li>Graph generative models </li>
						<li>Combination of graphs with other SOTA domains (e.g. self-supervised learning, federated
							learning)</li>

					</ul>

					<h2>Applications covered include but are not limited to: </h2>

					<li>Image segmentation, registration, classification</li>
					<li>Graph representations in pathology imaging and whole-slide image analysis</li>

					<li>Combining multimodal/multi-omics data through graph structures</li>
					<li>Graph analysis of brain networks and connectomics</li>

						<h4>
							<b>
								Preliminary topic: Trustworthy AI with GNN Explainer
							</b>
						</h4>

						<p>
							Dr.Zitnik investigates machine learning for science and medicine. Her methods leverage
							biomedical data at the scale of billions of interactions among millions of entities, blend
							machine learning with statistics and data science, and infuse biomedical knowledge into deep
							learning. Problems she investigates are motivated by network biology and medicine, genomics,
							drug discovery, and health. Dr. Zitnik's research vision is that in the future data science
							and artificial intelligence will be routinely used to give clinicians diagnostic
							recommendations; give scientists testable hypotheses they can confirm experimentally and
							offer them insights into safe and precise treatments; and give patients guidance on
							self-care, e.g., how to lead a healthy lifestyle and recognize the disease early. To realize
							this vision, Dr. Zitnik develops methods to reason over rich interconnected data and
							translates the methods into solutions for biomedical problems. Before joining Harvard, Dr.
							Zitnik was a postdoctoral fellow in Computer Science at Stanford University and was involved
							in projects at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
							University of Ljubljana while also researching at Imperial College London, University of
							Toronto, Baylor College of Medicine, and Stanford University.
